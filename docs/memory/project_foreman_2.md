# Foreman 2.0 — Current Status

**Why:** Add Kafka/Redpanda as bot-to-bot communication layer and a local web UI. Slack bridge stays intact — zero breaking changes.

**How to apply:** Read this before touching any Foreman 2.0 code. If Foreman won't start, go straight to Emergency Recovery below.

---

## Current Health: ✅ STABLE — FlowSpec /f run parsing fixed

**Last known good commit:** `dea9d03`
**Rollback:** `git checkout 7a73338 -- src/mattermost.ts && npm run build`

---

## Infrastructure State

- **Docker Desktop**: installed and running
- **Redpanda**: running via `docker compose up` in `/Users/chris.shreve/claude-slack-bridge`
  - Kafka broker: `localhost:19092`
  - Console UI: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Bot topics** auto-created on startup: `betty.inbox/outbox`, `clive.inbox/outbox`, `gemini-worker.inbox/outbox`, `gpt-worker.inbox/outbox`, `claude-judge.inbox/outbox`, `test-double.inbox/outbox`
- **Temporal**: runs natively via Homebrew (`temporal server start-dev`) — NOT in Docker

## What's Been Built

### Phase 1 ✅ — Foundation
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bots.yaml` | Bot registry — single source of truth for all bot identities |
| `src/bots.ts` | YAML parser, `getAllBots()`, `getAllTopics()`, `getBot()` |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Redpanda broker + Console only |

### Phase 2 ✅ — Kafka Bot Runner
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/kafka.ts` | KafkaJS client, `ensureBotTopics()`, `getProducer()`, `startBotConsumers()`, `callBot()` |
| `src/temporal/activities.ts` | Added `dispatchToBotInbox(botInboxName, prompt)` — Kafka dispatch, `dispatchToBot()` untouched |
| `src/index.ts` | Wires `loadBotRegistry()`, `ensureBotTopics()`, `startBotConsumers()` on startup |

**Two dispatch functions — critical design decision:**
- `dispatchToBot(channelId, prompt)` — UNCHANGED. Direct SDK call, Slack transport.
- `dispatchToBotInbox("betty.inbox", prompt)` — NEW. Kafka transport. Awaits `correlationId` on outbox.

### Phase 3 ✅ — Foreman UI
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/canvases.ts` | Canvas persistence to `~/.foreman/canvases.json` |
| `src/ui-api.ts` | Express routes: `/api/bots`, `/api/chat`, `/api/events` (SSE), `/api/canvas/:botName` CRUD, `/api/roster`, `POST/DELETE /api/roster/folders/*folderPath`, `POST /api/command` |
| `src/ui-claude.ts` | WebSocket Architect handler — Claude Agent SDK → browser. PreToolUse hooks for tool progress. Stats footer (cost/turns/elapsed). cwd = repo root. sessionId persisted under `ui:architect`. |
| `src/webhook.ts` | HTTP + WebSocket server on port 3001 |
| `src/mcp-canvas.ts` | SelfReboot allowed from `ui:architect` channel |
| `src/roster-overrides.ts` | Persists bot→folder overrides to `~/.foreman/roster-overrides.json` |
| `src/bots.ts` | `RosterNode`, `getRosterTree()`, real-time bot status SSE stream |
| `ui/` | Vite + React + Tailwind frontend (plain JS) |

**UI features live:**
- Bot Roster — left nav with recursive folder tree, drag-and-drop, folder creation/deletion
- Bot status indicators — 🟢🟡🔴 via SSE stream
- Architect chat — WebSocket streaming, tool approval cards, session memory across refreshes
- Tool progress — italic `_Reading path..._` lines before each response (via PreToolUse hooks)
- Stats footer — `Done in N turns | $X.XXXX | Xs` after each response
- Message timestamps
- Auto-reconnect — exponential backoff (1s→2s→4s→8s→15s max) + "Reboot successful" message
- Bot chat — HTTP chat with any bot via Kafka
- Canvas tabs — per-bot canvas persistence
- `/f` commands — `/f session`, `/f model`, `/f name`, `/f auto-approve`, `/f new`, `/f stop`

**How to start:**
```bash
# Terminal 1 — Foreman backend (port 3001)
cd /Users/chris.shreve/claude-slack-bridge
npm run build && node dist/index.js

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server (port 5173)
cd /Users/chris.shreve/claude-slack-bridge
npm run ui
```

## Known Gotchas

### ESM/CJS (incident 2026-04-03)
KafkaJS named imports crash at runtime in ESM. Always use default import + destructure:
```typescript
import kafkajs, { type Producer, type Admin } from 'kafkajs';
const { Kafka, logLevel, CompressionTypes, CompressionCodecs } = kafkajs;
```

### PreToolUse hooks vs canUseTool
`~/.claude/settings.local.json` pre-approves Bash/Read/Edit/Write/Glob/Grep etc. at the settings level. The SDK bypasses `canUseTool` for pre-approved tools. **Always use `PreToolUse` hooks for progress notifications**, not `canUseTool`. `canUseTool` is only for tools NOT in the settings allow list.

### Express 5 wildcards
Express 5 uses `path-to-regexp` v8 — bare `*` wildcards are invalid. Use named wildcards: `/*folderPath`.

### Socket Mode WebSocket instability
If Foreman stops responding to every other Slack message, check `~/.foreman/foreman.err.log` for `pong wasn't received` errors. This means the Socket Mode WS to Slack keeps dropping. Fix: `SelfReboot` (no code change needed, just a fresh connection).

| Workspace bots via Kafka (namespaced topics) | ✅ |
| Persistent outbox consumer (correlation ID routing) | ✅ |
| Stateful bot sessions (per-bot conversation history) | ✅ |
| Resizable LeftNav with drag handle | ✅ |
| Bot status dots for workspace bots | ✅ |
| LeftNav polish (System/Bots/Workspaces labels, console links) | ✅ |
| Instant scroll on bot switch | ✅ |

---

## Phase 5 ✅ — Mattermost Bridge (replaces custom React UI)

**Decision (2026-04-07):** Instead of building a custom conversation layer (Kafka log topics + pagination API), we adopted Mattermost — it provides channels, persistent history, pagination, search, threads, reactions, and a polished UI out of the box.

### What's live
| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Mattermost + PostgreSQL in docker-compose | ✅ Running at `localhost:8065` |
| 7 bot accounts (architect, betty, clive, gemini-worker, gpt-worker, claude-judge, test-double) | ✅ Created with tokens |
| `src/mattermost.ts` — WebSocket bridge (1:1 port of slack.ts) | ✅ |
| Message handling (user → Claude → response) | ✅ |
| /cc commands (cwd, model, name, session, new, stop, auto-approve, plugin) | ✅ |
| Tool approval via interactive message buttons | ✅ |
| Wired into index.ts startup | ✅ |

### Architecture
- Mattermost Team Edition (MIT license, self-hosted, Docker)
- `platform: linux/amd64` in docker-compose for Apple Silicon (Rosetta emulation)
- Raw `fetch` + `ws` for API calls (no @mattermost/client SDK — CJS/browser issues)
- Admin token on WebSocket receives all events; bot-specific tokens post responses
- Slack bridge runs in parallel — both transports work simultaneously

### Still TODO
- [x] **Verify FlowSpec workflows still run** — confirmed end-to-end in Mattermost (hello-world.flow + peer-review.flow)
- [x] **Migrate memory files into Foreman** — done (2026-04-08), now in `docs/memory/`
- [ ] Port canvas commands to Mattermost
- [ ] Port quorum/delphi/dispatch commands
- [ ] MCP tools (PostMessage, ReadChannel) — add Mattermost variants
- [ ] Remove custom React UI once Mattermost is fully proven

### Completed ✅
- [x] Approve/Deny callback — `host.docker.internal` + `AllowedUntrustedInternalConnections` working; confirmed end-to-end with auto-approve off
- [x] `/f` slash command rename + auto-registration — commit `9444e66`
- [x] Wire direct bot routing (Betty, Clive, etc.) — own persona + token per channel
- [x] 🤔 reaction + typing indicator with bot tokens
- [x] Tool progress detail (Bash command, Edit/Write paths)
- [x] Remove ✅ reaction

### Conversation Layer Design (preserved for Kafka log topics)
The original design for persistent conversations via Kafka log topics is saved in [project_conversation_layer.md](project_conversation_layer.md). Now that Mattermost handles conversation storage, the `{bot}.log` topic concept may still be useful for cross-platform replay (e.g., replaying a Mattermost conversation in a different context).

## Phase 6 — Planned (future)

### MCP Toolbelt Decomposition
Break the monolithic `foreman-toolbelt` (38 tools in `mcp-canvas.ts`) into domain-specific MCP servers:
- **`foreman-canvas`** — CanvasList, CanvasRead, CanvasFindSection, CanvasCreate, CanvasAppend, CanvasDelete, CanvasReadById, CanvasUpdateElementById, CanvasDeleteElementById
- **`foreman-jira`** — JiraCreateTicket, JiraUpdateTicket, JiraDeleteTicket, JiraReadTicket, JiraSearch, JiraAddComment, JiraUpdateComment, JiraDeleteComment, JiraTransitionTicket, JiraAssignTicket, JiraGetTransitions, JiraGetFieldOptions, JiraSetField
- **`foreman-confluence`** — ConfluenceReadPage, ConfluenceSearch, ConfluenceCreatePage, ConfluenceUpdatePage
- **`foreman-github`** — GitHubCreatePR, GitHubReadPR, GitHubReadIssue, GitHubSearch, GitHubListPRs
- **`foreman-comms`** — PostMessage, GetCurrentChannel, ReadChannel
- **`foreman-infra`** — SelfReboot, TriggerBitrise, LaunchApp, DiagramCreate

**Why:** (1) Per-bot tool scoping — assign only relevant toolbelts to each bot via `bots.yaml`. (2) Avoid tool collision — when a repo's `.claude/settings.json` brings in the official Atlassian MCP, Foreman's Jira tools overlap with identical functionality. Domain separation lets you exclude `foreman-jira` for bots that already have the official MCP. (3) Reduce token noise — fewer tools in the system prompt means faster, cheaper, more focused responses.

**Approach:** Extract each domain from `mcp-canvas.ts` into its own file (`mcp-jira.ts`, `mcp-confluence.ts`, etc.), each exporting a `createXxxMcpServer()` function. Update `mcp-canvas.ts` to compose them. Wire per-bot toolbelt selection through `bots.yaml` config.

### Consolidate Bot Registry & Channel Routing
Currently two separate "bots" files with confusing overlap:
- **`bots.yaml`** (repo root, visible) — bot identity: name, type, model, system prompt, roster group
- **`~/.foreman/bots.json`** (hidden in home dir) — FlowSpec channel routing: bot name → channel ID

**Plan (Option B):**
1. Move `~/.foreman/bots.json` → `config/channel-registry.yaml` (in repo, visible, version-controlled)
2. Restructure as transport-grouped YAML:
   ```yaml
   # config/channel-registry.yaml — Where each bot lives, per transport
   slack:
     flowbot-01: C0AP5TEMBL2
     flowbot-02: C0AP3RSGQJJ
   mattermost:
     flowbot-01: w3fkpfdzd38z5fkei3sdabnhyo
     flowbot-02: witk91ucbjgh58buud53s6w83o
   ```
3. Update `flowspec/registry.ts` to read from `config/channel-registry.yaml` instead of `~/.foreman/bots.json`
4. Delete `~/.foreman/bots.json` after migration

**Why:** (1) Hidden state is undiscoverable — new devs can't find `~/.foreman/bots.json` without tribal knowledge. (2) Two files both named "bots" is confusing. (3) Identity (`bots.yaml`) and routing (`channel-registry.yaml`) are separate concerns — devs who only chat with bots never need the channel registry, but FlowSpec users do. (4) YAML is consistent with `bots.yaml` and human-readable. (5) Version-controlled means changes are tracked and reviewable.

### FlowSpec Tutorial
Create an interactive onboarding tutorial for new devs that covers:
- What FlowSpec is and why it exists (orchestrating multi-bot workflows)
- How the dispatch chain works: flow file → bot name → `bots.yaml` → channel ID → Temporal → bot
- Writing your first flow file (inputs, assign, steps, collect)
- Running workflows: `/f run`, `--name`, input parameters, `/f check`
- Key concepts: categories don't matter, any channel can invoke, bots resolve by name not location
- Debugging: where to look when a flow fails (Temporal UI, bot channel output, `foreman.err.log`)

**Why:** FlowSpec is the most powerful and least documented part of Foreman. New devs (and new bots) need to understand the dispatch model to be effective. The questions from this session (does category matter? does invoking channel matter? which Jira tool wins?) are exactly what a tutorial should answer upfront.

### Dynamic Bot Resolution (No-Reboot Bot Management)
Currently `mattermost.ts` builds a static `botUserMap` at startup from Mattermost bot accounts + `mattermostBotTokens` in config. Adding a new bot requires creating a Mattermost bot account, adding its token to config, AND restarting Foreman.

**Goal:** Adding a new bot to a workflow should never require a Foreman reboot. Resolve bot config dynamically from `channel-registry.yaml` → `bots.yaml` instead of from the startup cache.

**Why this is hard today:** `identifyChannelBot()` matches channel members against `botUserMap` (keyed by Mattermost user ID). This means each bot identity needs its own Mattermost bot account. The Foreman bot can't serve as multiple identities because it always resolves to one config.

**Possible approach:** Flip the lookup — instead of "which bot user is in this channel?", do "which bot name does this channel map to?" by reversing `channel-registry.yaml` at startup into a `channelId → botName` map. Then look up the bot definition from `bots.yaml`. This removes the need for per-bot Mattermost accounts entirely — one Foreman bot account could serve all channels with different personas.

### Other
- **Mobile-friendly layout** — collapsible sidebar, hamburger menu
- **Ollama adapter** — local open source LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral, etc.) as bots in `bots.yaml`
- **Dockerize Temporal** — add to docker-compose.yml
- **Dockerize everything** — single `docker compose up` for full stack
- **Image attachment in chat**
- **FlowSpec workspace-aware bot namespace resolution** — `@claude-worker` resolves to `techops-2187/claude-worker` when run inside a workspace
- **Enhance `/f session tools`** — list all available tools grouped by source (foreman toolbelts, project MCPs, Claude Code built-ins, plugins)
